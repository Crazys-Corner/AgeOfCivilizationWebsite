    <h1 style="text-align:center">Why we should fire Redstone</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Redstone has shown numerous times that he cannot act professional around anyone.  </h3> 
<span style="text-align: center;"><p>First it was him mocking the LGBT by making his pronouns "attack/helicopter"  | <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1084255895057342494/1084255901088759918/image.png">Source</a></span>
<br><br> <span style="text-align: center;">This came from a book titled "I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter" by Isabel Fall. It was about a woman named Barb, whose gender had been reassigned to "attack helicopter" to make her a better pilot. 
The story went onto being renamed as "Helicopter Story" to prevent sounding homo/transphobic. This change happened due to the internet using it to be transphobic, this caused the book to be withdrawn from most public access after a transgender woman-was harrassed because of it.</span> 
<br> <br> 
<span style="text-align:center"><p>Second was him starting an entire argument in front of the entire server due to his personal beliefs. Sadly, the actual arguement had been deleted. It was purged by CarlBot, redstone claims silent told him to do this, however silent says otherwise. | <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1084255895057342494/1084257644199555153/image.png">Proof</a></p> </span>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: center; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;">Whilst there is not any concrete evidence about this, ‚ô°Kitty‚ô°#4599, RageinHalo üçÉ#2173, crazy's_corner#6583, and Redstxnelol#4860 himself can attest to this happening. His arguement was basically on 
how political figures such as Joseph Biden and other leftist political figures were pathetic and wrong and that right-winged figures such as Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are the saviors of the US. He also claimed that LGBT people have the same rights as others, claiming that if a Gender-Non-Conforming (GNC) male goes outside
in feminine clothing, it's their fault that they got assaulted (That was infact, almost word-for-word.) </span>
<span style="text-align: center"><p>My last reason (for now) is that he barely does his job, and proceeds to complain that he doesn't have work. Proof below</p></span>

<span>Howdy explaining that what she just read was pathetic. </span>

<span><h4>Overall Red shows extreme lack of professionalism and should be removed. I personally don't want to work with him as he's very annoying and hard to work with.
    He constantly acts like he's better than everyone and is not a good co-worker.
